# <font size="12">**TECHNOLOGY INCLUSIVE <br />LANGUAGE GUIDEBOOK**</font>

As an organization, Accenture believes in building an inclusive workplace and contributing to a world where equality thrives. Certain terms or expressions can unintentionally harm, perpetuate damaging stereotypes, and insult people. Inclusive language avoids bias, slang terms, and word choices which express derision of groups of people based on race, gender, sexuality, or socioeconomic status.  The Accenture North America Technology team created this guidebook to provide Accenture employees with a view into inclusive language and guidance for working to avoid its use—helping to ensure that we communicate with respect, dignity and fairness.

**How to use this guide?**

Accenture has over 514,000 employees from diverse backgrounds, who perform consulting and delivery work for an equally diverse set of clients and partners. When communicating with your colleagues and representing Accenture, consider the connotation, however unintended, of certain terms in your written and verbal communication. The guidelines are intended to help you recognize non-inclusive words and understand potential meanings that these words might convey. Our goal with these recommendations is not to require you to use specific words, but to ask you to take a moment to consider how your audience may be affected by the language you choose.

            <td>primary <br />client <br />source <br />leader</td>
            <td rowspan=2>Using the terms “master/slave” in this context inappropriately normalizes and minimizes the very large magnitude that slavery and its effects have had in our history.</td>

            <td>blacklist</td>
            <td>deny list <br />block list</td>
            <td rowspan=2>The term “blacklist” was first used in the early 1600s to describe a list of those who were under suspicion and thus not to be trusted, whereas “whitelist” referred to those considered acceptable.  Accenture does not want to promote the association of “black” and negative, nor the connotation of “white” being the inverse, or positive.</td>

            <td>native</td>
            <td>original <br />core feature</td>
            <td rowspan=2>Referring to “native” vs “non-native” to describe technology platforms carries overtones of minimizing the impact of colonialism on native people, and thus minimizes the negative associations the terminology has in the latter context.</td>

            <td>man-hours</td>
            <td>work-hours <br />business-hours</td>
            <td rowspan=2>When people read the words ‘man’ or ‘he,’ people often picture males only. Usage of the male terminology subtly suggests that only males can perform certain work or hold certain jobs. Gender-neutral terms include the whole audience, and thus using terms such as “business executive” instead of “businessman,” or informally, “folks” instead of “guys” is preferable because it is inclusive.</td>

            <td rowspan=2>Using the “Human Engagement, People First’ approach, putting people  - all people - at the center is
