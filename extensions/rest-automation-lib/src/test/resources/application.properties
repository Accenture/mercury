# Server port when running locally
# This value may be mapped to port 80 when deployed to cloud
#
# If this parameter is not available, it will fall back to use "server.port".
# This additional parameter allows rest-automation library to be used with the "rest-spring" library
# when traditional JAX-RS and servlets are needed.
#
# When used with rest-spring library, your application would use 2 ports:
# one for rest-automation ("rest.server.port") and the other for rest-spring ("server.port")
