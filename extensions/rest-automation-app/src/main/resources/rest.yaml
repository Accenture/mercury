# REST automation is the recommended way to create REST endpoints properly
# Note that URL comparison is case insensitive but case sensitivity is preserved
# for the original URL and path parameters

rest:
  # The REST automation system includes a built-in websocket notification system.
  # If you want to enable this feature, you must add the ws.token.issuer service as
  # shown in this example. For added security, please enable authentication and point
  # it to a user defined authentication service that may authenticate the user credentials
  # and validate that the user is allowed to use a specific websocket application.
  #
  # the "ws.token.issuer" and "ws.notification" are reserved by the system for
  # websocket connection token issuance and notification topic query services

# WebSocket automation is designed primarily for real-time notification.
# However, you may also use it to receive messages from a browser or external application.
#
# You can also send notification events using the NotificationService API
# Please refer to user guide for details.
# https://github.com/Accenture/mercury/tree/master/docs/guides
#
# The format of a valid web-socket URL is /ws/api/{application}:{token}?query_parameters
#
# In the following example entry, the application name is "notification".
# You can use the websocket connection with or without notification feature.
# If you want notification feature, set "subscribe" to true and your UI can send subscription API via
# a websocket connecton. If you allow the UI to send notification events to other browsers, you can turn on "publish".
#
# If you want to handle the input programmatically at the backend, you can set a "recipient" route name
# that points to a custom function that you provide.
#
# When publish/subscribe features are set to false, you must provide a "recipient" function otherwise
# the websocket becomes a "no-op" connection, thus wasting networking resources.
#
websocket:
  - application: "notification"
    publish: true
    subscribe: true
#    recipient: "my.ws.handler"
