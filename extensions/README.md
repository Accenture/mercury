## REST automation helper application

This is a convenient helper application to let you create REST endpoints without writing code.

It is as simple as a redirection from a URL to a service route of a function. Supports CORS, header transformation and user-defined authentication.

The REST automation helper application is language neutual so you can write your business logic in Java, Python or any Mercury supported language pack without any application server.
