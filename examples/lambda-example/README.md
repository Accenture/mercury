# Composable application example

The lambda-example demonstrates REST automation (light weight non-blocking HTTP server) that allows you
to create REST endpoints by configuration instead of code.

It illustrates building individual event-driven functions using Java (LambdaFunction and TypedLambdaFunction) and
Kotlin (suspend function that implements the KotlinLambdaFunction interface).

Unit test examples are also provided.
