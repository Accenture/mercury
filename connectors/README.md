# Cloud connectors

The core modules include the foundation cloud connector and service monitor.

The "adapters" folder contains the specific implementations for Kafka, Hazelcast, ActiveMQ and Tibco.

The cloud connectors and adapters are optional modules to build a minimalist service mesh.

## Cloud native skill requirements

Setting a service mesh requires cloud native and basic DevSecOps skills. Please contact your Accenture
representative if you need additional assistance.

## Event over HTTP

If service mesh is not suitable, please consider the "Event over HTTP" method as an alternative to connect
application PODs.

Please review Chapter 7 in the "Developer guide" for details.
