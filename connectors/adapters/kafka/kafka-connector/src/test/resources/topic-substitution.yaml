# topic substitution example
#
# The default service monitor and multiplex topics are prefixed as service.monitor and multiplex.n
# where n starts from 0001
#
# PARTITION DEFINITION
# --------------------
# For the replacement topic, an optional partition number can be defined using the "#n" suffix.
# Partition number must be a positive number from 0 to the max partition of the specific topic.
#
# If partition number if not given, the entire topic will be used to send/receive events.
# e.g.
# SERVICE.APP.ONE is a topic of at least one partition
# user.app#0 is the topic "user.app" and partition "0"
#
service:
  monitor:
    0: SERVICE.APP.ONE
    1: SERVICE.APP.TWO
    2: SERVICE.APP.THREE
    3: SERVICE.APP.FOUR
