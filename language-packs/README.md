# Language packs

Language packs are designed to be minimalist. It connects to the network through a language-connector.

The language-connector is a "sidecar" application that you can deploy with your application that is built with a language pack.

## Python

You can clone the python language pack from https://github.com/Accenture/mercury-python

The python language pack can be used to build standalone event-driven application or scalable application.
For scalable application, please build and start the "language-support" application.

Your application using the Python language pack will automatically connect to the language-support service.
