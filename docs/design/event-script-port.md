## 1. Goal & scope

Port **Event Script** — layer 2, *composable orchestration*: a YAML DSL that describes an
end-to-end transaction as a **flow** choreographing composable functions by route name,
executed by a flow engine with a per-transaction **state machine** (`model`). Orchestration
moves out of code into configuration; functions stay the layer-1 building blocks. A flow
never references a function's implementation — only its route (the layer-1 invariant
`inv-never-couple-functions` carried up an altitude).

The engine rides *entirely* on the platform-core foundation we just measured: every engine
component is itself a composable function (registered with the increment-10 annotations),
and every task execution is an event over the bus.

## 2. Proposed decisions (maintainer gate)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | **New crate `crates/event-script`**, depending only on `platform-core` | D5's workspace layout pays off; mirrors the Java module split (`event-script-engine` depends only on `platform-core`). |
| E2 | **Flow YAML syntax verbatim (D9 extended to the DSL)** — and **reuse the Java test fixtures unchanged** (51 flows + 20 negative parser fixtures + `flows.yaml`) | The flow files are config-data; a flow written for Java mercury must compile on Rust mercury unchanged. Reusing the canonical fixtures gives us behavior-parity tests for free and keeps the two repos side-by-side comparable. |
| E3 | **Flow state machine on the bus value tree (`rmpv::Value`)** with a runtime `MultiLevelMap` — **direct composite-key traversal is the PRIMARY data-mapping tool** (lightweight, zero conversion, byte-fidelity like Java's `Object` tree); **`$.…` is the user-defined complex query**, delegated to a real JSONPath crate (`serde_json_path`, RFC 9535) over an on-demand JSON view *(refined from serde_json::Value at the E-2 gate — maintainer decision 2026-07-16)* | Java's `MultiLevelMap.getElement` delegates `$`-prefixed paths to the Jayway JsonPath library — a genuine JSONPath engine, not a subset; matching it needs a real implementation. Envelope bodies (rmpv) already convert to/from JSON at the HTTP boundary; flow state is boundary data. |
| E4 | **Engine components register via the increment-10 annotations** | `event.script.manager`, `task.executor`, `http.flow.adapter`, `resilience.handler` are `#[preload]` functions; `CompileFlows` is `#[before_application(sequence = 5)]`; the plugin loader seq 3 — exactly the Java sequence contract (essential 0 < plugins 3 < flows 5 < user ≥ 6). Cross-crate `inventory` collection (built for this) makes the engine self-register when an app links `event-script`. |
| E5 | **Minimal platform-core extensions, shipped in lockstep**: (a) an **event-interceptor** registration mode (function receives the raw envelope incl. `reply_to`/`cid` metadata and replies manually — no auto-reply); (b) **scheduled events** (`send_later` + cancel) for the flow TTL watcher; (c) rest.yaml **`flow:` key** → REST automation injects the `x-flow-id` header (Java parity); (d) an envelope-body **deep-copy** helper | The engine's core classes are `@EventInterceptor` in Java; our worker currently always auto-replies. The TTL watcher is `sendLater`/`cancelFutureEvent`. All four are additive platform-core features other layers will reuse. |
| E6 | **Simple plugins are compiled Rust registered by a `#[simple_plugin]` annotation**; Java's runtime bytecode-safety allowlist is **not ported** (documented divergence) | Java scans `@SimplePlugin` classes at runtime and verifies their bytecode only touches `java.lang/util/math/time`. Rust has no runtime class loading — plugins are compiled, reviewed code linked into the binary; the allowlist's threat model doesn't exist. The registry + `f:name(args)` resolution semantics are ported faithfully. |
| E7 | **TTL watcher = an abortable tokio timer task** behind the `send_later` API | Same observable behavior (timeout → abort flow with 408, fire end-flow listeners, close instance); map-don't-mirror on the mechanism. |
| E8 | **`EventScriptMock` + task monitors ported** (a later increment, before milestone close) | The Java test suite leans on it; flow tests in downstream apps will too. |
| E9 | **Kotlin/reactor stream fields deferred** (`stream` in the HTTP dataset) with platform-core §7 streams | Same deferral as REST-automation streaming; the dataset key is carried as-is (null) so mappings referencing it don't break. |

## 3. Architecture mapping (Java → Rust)

| event-script-engine (Java) | event-script (Rust) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CompileFlows` (`@BeforeApplication` seq 5) | `compiler.rs` — `#[before_application(sequence = 5)]` | reads `yaml.flow.automation` (default `classpath:/flows.yaml`): per file `location` prefix (default `classpath:/flows/`) + `flows:` list; full grammar validation at startup |
| `Flows` (static registries) | `flows.rs` — process-wide registries (`OnceLock` + `RwLock` maps) | flow templates + live flow instances |
| `Flow` / `Task` | `model.rs` structs | compiled task graph: input/output mapping lists, `next_steps`, `pipeline_steps`, `join_task`, `exception_task`, loop metadata (type/init/comparator/sequencer/conditions), `delay`/`delay_var`, monitors |
| `FlowInstance` | `instance.rs` | dataset `{input, model:{instance, cid, ttl, flow, trace, parent, root}}`; pipe map; task metrics; TTL watcher; `responded`/`running` state |
| `EventScriptManager` (`event.script.manager`) | interceptor `#[preload]` | launch event (header `flow_id`, body = input dataset, business `correlation_id` header) → new instance → first task |
| `TaskExecutor` (`task.executor`) | interceptor `#[preload]` — the heart | composite correlation id `uuid#seq`; input mapping → invoke function (reply→task.executor) or `flow://` sub-flow → output mapping → route by execution type; exceptions; per-task trace + metrics |
| `HttpToFlow` (`http.flow.adapter` ×200) | interceptor `#[preload(..., env_instances)]` | AsyncHttpRequest → input dataset (header/body/cookie/path_parameter/method/uri/query/ip/filename/session/ttl); `x-flow-id`; `X-Correlation-Id` (configurable) → business cid |
| `FlowExecutor` (programmatic) | `executor.rs` API | `launch(...)` fire-and-forget + `request(...)` RPC |
| `SimplePluginLoader` (`@BeforeApplication` seq 3) + `@SimplePlugin` | `#[simple_plugin]` + inventory registry | ~40 built-ins: arithmetic, generators (uuid/now/date), logical operators (incl. ternary/and/or), type conversions & list-of-map ops |
| `Resilience4Flow` (`resilience.handler` ×500) | `#[preload]` function | max_attempts, alternative routes, backoff / backoff_trigger / backoff_seconds, cumulative failure counting |
| `SimpleExceptionHandler` | ported with it | |
| `DataMappingHelper` (617 LOC) | `mapping.rs` | LHS/RHS mini-language (below) |
| Jayway JsonPath (via platform-core `MultiLevelMap`) | `serde_json_path` (E3) | `$.…` sources |
| `EventScriptMock` + task monitors | `mock.rs` (E8) | test-time route reassignment + before/after task monitors |

## 4. The DSL (what the compiler enforces)

`flow-grammar.md` is the deterministic spec; the Rust compiler must enforce the same
compile-time invariants (violations fail flow loading, never runtime):

- Flow: `flow.id`, `flow.description`, `flow.ttl` (≥ 1s), `first.task`, `tasks` all present;
  ≥ 1 `end` task; duplicate flow ids rejected; `ext:` targets require
  `external.state.machine`; task `name` required when the same `process` repeats.
- Eight execution types with `next`-shape rules: `sequential`/`response`/`pipeline`
  exactly 1; `decision` ≥ 2 (+ an output mapping to `decision`); `parallel` ≥ 2;
  `fork` ≥ 1 + `join`; `end`/`sink` none.
- Data mapping `'source -> target'` (3-part `LHS -> model.var -> RHS` compiles to two):
  LHS namespaces `input.*`, `model.*` (incl. `model.parent.*`/`model.root.*`, dynamic
  `{model.key}` interpolation, `.ITEM`/`.INDEX`), `error.*`, `$.…`, constants
  (`text/int/long/float/double/boolean/map/file/classpath`), `f:plugin(args)`, and — in
  `output` — `result[.x]`, `status`, `header[.x]`, `datatype`; type-conversion suffixes
  (`:text :int :long :float :double :boolean :binary :b64 :! :uuid :length
  :substring(a[,b]) :concat(…) :and(k) :or(k)`). RHS namespaces: function input body
  (bare) / `header.*` on `input` rules; `output.*`, `model.*`, `decision`,
  `file(path)`/`file(append:path)`, `ext:…` on `output` rules; `[]` appends.
- Reserved read-only model keys (`model.cid/instance/flow/ttl/trace/none` and the
  `parent`/`root` roots) must never be mapping targets.
- Pipeline `loop`: `statement: 'for (init; comparator; sequencer)'` (`++`/`--`) or
  `while (model.key)`; `condition: 'if (model.x) break/continue'`.

## 5. Increment plan

Bottom-up so each increment is independently testable; Java fixtures reused from the start.

1. **E-1 — Flow model + compiler.** `crates/event-script`: model structs, `flows.yaml`
   discovery (`yaml.flow.automation`), the full grammar validation, `#[before_application]`
   registration. Tests: all 51 Java flow fixtures compile with identical results; the 20
   `parser-flows` negatives fail with the right complaints. No runtime yet.
2. **E-2 — Data-mapping engine.** `mapping.rs` as pure functions over a JSON dataset:
   LHS/RHS resolution, constants, type suffixes, dynamic keys, JSONPath, `file()`/
   `classpath()` descriptors, the reserved-key guard. Unit-testable without the bus.
3. **E-3 — platform-core extensions (lockstep, additive).** Interceptor registration mode
   (annotation flag + worker no-auto-reply), `send_later`/cancel, rest.yaml `flow:` key →
   `x-flow-id` injection, body deep-copy. Ships as a platform-core increment with its own
   tests (INCREMENTS.md row); event-script waits on it.
4. **E-4 — Core runtime.** `Flows` registries, `FlowInstance`, `EventScriptManager`,
   `TaskExecutor` for `sequential` / `response` / `end` / `decision`, exception routing
   (task-level > `flow.exception`), TTL abort (408), per-task trace + metrics,
   `FlowExecutor` launch/request. First E2E fixtures: greetings, decision, response,
   timeout, exception.
5. **E-5 — Concurrency constructs.** `parallel`, `fork`/`join` (incl. dynamic `source`
   iteration with `.ITEM`/`.INDEX`), `sink`.
6. **E-6 — Pipelines & loops.** `pipeline` execution, `for`/`while`, `break`/`continue`.
7. **E-7 — Sub-flows & shared state.** `flow://` processes, `model.parent.*`/`model.root.*`,
   external state machine (`ext:`).
8. **E-8 — Simple plugins.** `#[simple_plugin]` macro + registry + the built-in set
   (arithmetic/generators/logical/types), `f:` resolution in mappings.
9. **E-9 — HTTP adapter, resilience, mock — milestone close.** `HttpToFlow`,
   `Resilience4Flow`, `SimpleExceptionHandler`, `EventScriptMock` + monitors, and a new
   **`examples/hello-flow`** app (the increment-10 `examples/<name>/` convention): a
   rest.yaml `flow:` endpoint running a real flow end-to-end.

Each increment: `cargo test` + clippy + fmt clean, INCREMENTS.md row + section, design-doc
increment note — the platform-core definition of done, unchanged.

## 5a. Increment E-1 — flow model + compiler (implemented 2026-07-16)

`crates/event-script` created: `model` (`Flow`/`Task`), `flows` (template registry),
`compiler` (full `CompileFlows` port — `yaml.flow.automation` discovery, grammar
validation, Java failure semantics: unreadable list = WARN+skip, invalid flow =
ERROR+skip, invalid mapping = drop the TASK but keep the flow), `converter` (legacy
`:type` → `f:plugin(...)` rewriting incl. negate / boolean value-match / concat /
substring forms), `validator` (mapping-syntax rules + the reserved-state-machine-key
guard, exported for the E-4 runtime re-check) and `plugins` (the plugin **name**
registry with the 42 built-in names — pulled forward from E-8 because `validInput`
checks `f:` names at compile time; execution bodies stay E-8). The engine
self-registers via `#[before_application(sequence = 5)]`.

**Fixtures:** all 90 Java flow files reused verbatim (55 in `flows.yaml` + 35 in
`more-flows.yaml`, incl. the intentional duplicate and a missing-file location).
Parity pinned by tests: the exact loaded-flow set, every whole-flow rejection, the
task-dropped-flow-loads semantics (parser-tests 23/25/26/27/28–31), normalized
mapping strings (3-part decomposition, negation, plugin rewrites — asserted against
the greetings fixture), loop/fork/sub-flow metadata. **Two findings where the code,
not the fixture comment, is authoritative** (verified against the Java source):
`invalid-condition-mode` (parser-test-7) is grammar-valid legacy naming and LOADS;
parser-test-19's `ext.user` (dot form) is a plain body key — only the `ext:`
namespace triggers the `external.state.machine` requirement — so it loads too.

## 5b. Increment E-2 — data-mapping engine (implemented 2026-07-16)

*Maintainer refinement at the gate: MultiLevelMap (direct composite-key access) is the
primary data-mapping tool; JSONPath serves user-defined complex queries — which is also
exactly how the Java code is layered (`MultiLevelMap.getElement` delegates only
`$`-prefixed paths to Jayway).* Modules:

- **`mlm`** — the runtime `MultiLevelMap` over `rmpv::Value` (the bus currency; byte
  arrays are real `Binary` values like Java's `byte[]`): get/set/remove/exists/
  key_exists with Java semantics (null resolves to None but the key exists; lists pad
  with nulls; removal never shifts indices; `key[]` appends via `appendIndex`); `$.…`
  → `serde_json_path` on an on-demand JSON view (0 matches → none, 1 → scalar, many →
  array — Jayway-style).
- **`mapping`** — the `DataMappingHelper` resolution half: `get_constant_value`
  (text/int/long/float/double/boolean, `map(k=v,…)` literals + `map(config.key)` from
  the base configuration, `file()`/`classpath()` content via `SimpleFileDescriptor`
  with text/json/binary/append modes), `get_lhs_element` (`$` queries, `f:plugin(...)`
  invocation with top-level-comma argument splitting and the nested-plugin null guard,
  legacy `:type` commands on model selectors), `get_value_by_type` (simple commands +
  `substring`/`concat`/`and`/`or`/`boolean(…)` — bad commands log ERROR and pass the
  value through, Java parity), and the `{model.key}` runtime interpolation
  (`substituteRuntimeVarsIfAny`: strings/numbers interpolate, anything else renders
  "null", non-model braces pass through).
- **`conversions`** — `TypeConversionUtils` port, incl. Java `String.valueOf` display
  parity (null → "null", floats keep the decimal point) and the Java numeric fallbacks
  (`str2int`/`str2long` → −1 with decimal-drop).
- **`plugins`** — executable bodies for the 19 core conversion/logical plugins the
  legacy-syntax converter emits (`f:int`, `f:not`, `f:isNull`, `f:concat`,
  `f:substring`, `f:eq`, …); the remaining built-ins stay name-only and fail loudly
  until E-8.

**Tests:** module unit tests for every resolution rule, plus an integration test that
takes the **compiled greetings fixture from E-1** and evaluates its normalized input
mappings against a simulated HTTP dataset — asserting the exact function-input body the
Java engine produces (type conversions, negation chains, uuid identity across the
3-part decomposition, `{model.pointer}` interpolation, `f:concat` with a `text(,)`
argument, header targets).

## 5c. Increment E-3 — platform-core extensions (implemented 2026-07-16)

The four E5 extensions, landed in platform-core with their own tests (145 workspace):

- **Event-interceptor registration mode** (Java `@EventInterceptor`):
  `FunctionOptions { zero_traced, interceptor }` replaces the increment-10 bool on
  `register_with_options`/`preload_with_options`; the worker passes the raw envelope
  (`reply_to`/`cid` intact) and **ignores an interceptor's successful return — no
  auto-reply — while a failure still routes to `reply_to`** (verified against the Java
  `WorkerHandler`: only the success reply is interceptor-guarded). `#[preload]` gains
  an `interceptor` flag and a stacked `#[event_interceptor]` marker.
- **Scheduled events**: `PostOffice::send_later(event, delay) -> timer_id` +
  `cancel_future_event(id)` (Java `sendLater`/`cancelFutureEvent`) — an abortable
  tokio timer behind the same API (decision E7), self-removing on fire; built for the
  flow TTL watcher.
- **rest.yaml `flow:` binding**: `RouteInfo.flow` + the automation server injects
  `x-flow-id` into the request headers (what `http.flow.adapter` reads — Java parity).
  The platform-core §5e "flow binding" deferral closes.
- **Deep-copy**: satisfied by design — `rmpv::Value::clone()` IS a deep copy (owned
  tree, no shared references), so the Java `Utility.deepCopy` call site (the manager
  cloning the input payload) needs no new API. Documented here so the E5 checklist is
  accounted for.

Tests: manual-reply round-trip, no-auto-reply timeout proof, failure-still-replies,
send_later delivery/cancel semantics, flow-binding header injection (+ absence on
unbound endpoints), and the `#[event_interceptor]` marker end-to-end in the
annotations lifecycle test.

## 5d. Increment E-4 — core flow runtime (implemented 2026-07-16)

The engine executes real flows end-to-end: `FlowInstance` (state machine + TTL watcher
on E-3's `send_later`), the instance registry, `EventScriptManager` and `TaskExecutor`
as event interceptors, and the programmatic `FlowExecutor::launch`/`request` API.
*(§5d.1 superseded the initial one-instance-serialized registration: the engine routes
now run DIRECTLY on the event core, so callbacks execute concurrently — the instance
mutexes, not worker serialization, are the thread-safety story, matching Java.)*

- **Scope**: `sequential` / `response` / `end` / `decision` / `sink`; exception routing
  (task-level handler beats `flow.exception`; the top-level-exception flag guards
  handler loops); TTL abort (408); per-task metrics + the traced flow-summary span;
  deferred tasks (`delay` / `delay_var` via `send_later`); the `@retry|fallback`
  decision form; output `file()` targets; the `*` wildcard body; the
  `my_correlation_id` read-only header stamped last. `parallel`/`fork` (E-5),
  `pipeline` loops (E-6), `flow://` sub-flows + `ext:` (E-7) abort with explicit
  "later increment" messages instead of misbehaving.
- **State-machine semantics**: the consolidated mapping view is built **inside the
  instance's own dataset tree** (per-callback scratch keys — status/header/result/
  output/decision/error — stripped afterwards), so `model.*` writes persist exactly
  like Java's shared-reference map with zero model copies. The dynamic-index
  substitution re-checks runtime-resolved RHS targets against the reserved-key guard
  (Java `substituteDynamicIndex`), proven by the dynamic-reserved-key fixture.
- **E2E tests** (canonical fixtures + Java-parity task functions, all registered
  through the annotation inventory exactly as a user app would): greetings (type
  conversions, business-cid exposure, result-header copying, status mapping),
  boolean + numeric decisions (incl. out-of-range abort), sequential chaining with the
  `*` wildcard, response-before-end (early reply wins), exception → handler (409),
  TTL abort (408 with the caller-supplied `ttl` override), runtime reserved-key
  rejection, and fire-and-forget launch.

## 5d.1 — Direct execution for the reserved engine routes (implemented 2026-07-16)

*Maintainer-directed after a design review of Java's `EventEmitter.sendWithEventBus`:
port the optimization, but **hide it** — no macro flag, no registration option, no
interface contract; developers must not be able to opt application functions out of
reactive back-pressure.*

- **What**: `Platform::deliver` (and the worker reply path) checks a **private**
  reserved-route list — `event.script.manager`, `task.executor` (Java parity, same
  names hard-coded in the platform) — and executes those functions **directly on a
  fresh task** (`tokio::spawn`, instance 1, failures logged; the Java virtual-thread
  submit analog). No queue, no trace bracket, no auto-reply.
- **Why** (differs from Java's motivation): our bus is zero-copy, so Java's biggest
  saving — skipping `toBytes()` serialization per hop — does not exist in Rust. The
  wins here are (1) **concurrency**: orchestration no longer serializes through a
  single worker (worker-instance count is irrelevant, as in Java); (2) **liveness**:
  an event router that feeds itself through bounded mailboxes risks circular waits
  under saturation — the direct path removes the engine from the back-pressure graph
  by construction; (3) µs-level latency (one queue hop removed per task callback) and
  tracing parity (Java's direct path bypasses `WorkerHandler`, so the engine emits
  only the flow-summary span — ours now matches).
- **Safety**: both functions are stateless routers; `FlowInstance` state is
  mutex-protected and each callback's scratch-key mapping runs under one continuous
  dataset lock, so concurrent callbacks are correct. Back-pressure still applies where
  the real work happens — user-function mailboxes; flows stay TTL-bounded.
- **Proof tests**: 10×150 ms events to each reserved route with **1 worker instance**
  finish concurrently (peak concurrency > 1, wall-clock a fraction of serialized), while
  an identical probe on a normal route serializes (peak exactly 1 — the control); plus
  20 simultaneous end-to-end greetings transactions with distinct state machines.

## 5e. Increment E-5 — parallel + fork/join (implemented 2026-07-16)

- **`parallel`**: fan out to every `next` task (no barrier — Java parity; the flow
  converges through model state and a decision, as the canonical parallel-test fixture
  demonstrates).
- **`fork`/`join`**: a pipe-map entry (`JoinTaskInfo {forks, join_task, result_count}`)
  forms the barrier; each branch callback reports via its composite `uuid#seq`
  correlation id, and the last one fires the join task. A **dynamic `source`** model
  list replicates the single branch per element, exposing `<source>.ITEM` /
  `<source>.INDEX` pseudo-keys to each branch's input mapping (Java
  `getInputDataMappingLhsValue`). Exception cleanup is Java-exact: a task with its own
  handler clears only its pipe entry; otherwise all pipe queues clear before the
  generic handler runs.
- Increment 15's direct execution makes the forked callbacks genuinely concurrent —
  the barrier and the `[]`-append state-machine writes run under the pipe-map and
  dataset mutexes (the Java `modelSafety` analog), exercised by the tests.
- **Fixtures**: canonical parallel-test (racing branches converge via a shared-counter
  decision) and fork-n-join-test (happy path + a failing branch aborting the flow) run
  verbatim. The canonical dynamic-fork fixture needs `flow://` + `ext:` (E-7), so a
  clearly-marked **Rust-side supplement** (`tests/resources/flows-rust/
  dynamic-fork-test.yml`) covers `.ITEM`/`.INDEX` iteration and concurrent `[]`
  appends until E-7 activates the canonical one.

## 5f. Increment E-6 — pipelines with for/while loops (implemented 2026-07-16)

- **`pipeline`** execution: `PipelineState` (Java `PipelineInfo` — pointer, completed
  flag, clamped `nextStep`) joins the pipe map; step callbacks walk the ordered steps,
  the last step marks the pass complete, and the exit task (`next[0]`) runs after.
- **Loops**: `for` runs the initializer at entry, the sequencer (`model.n++`/`--`) at
  the end of each pass, and the comparator both times (model keys or integer literals,
  `<` `<=` `>` `>=`); `while` gates each pass on its model key being strictly boolean
  true — flows flip it with mappings like `model.n:boolean(3=false) -> model.running`
  (the E-2 converter/plugin path in action).
- **`break`/`continue` conditions** evaluate after every step callback (first true
  model key wins); `break` drops the pipe entry and exits, `continue` clears its flag
  (Java parity) and jumps to the pass completion.
- **Fixtures verbatim**: pipeline-test, for-loop-test (3 × 3 steps with `file()`
  append/read/delete round-trip), for-loop-break (quit flag at n==1), while-loop
  (per-step `delay` exercised; stops at n==3), pipeline-exception (a failing step
  routes to its own handler; the pipe entry cleanup from E-5 applies). The
  `decision.case` test task is now the faithful Java `DecisionCase` port (echo +
  increment + quit/jump/continue thresholds) — the loop workhorse.

## 5g. Increment E-7 — sub-flows, shared parent state, external state machine (implemented 2026-07-16)

- **`flow://` sub-flows**: a task whose process is `flow://{id}` launches the child
  through the manager (dataset `{ttl, body, header?}`, headers `parent`/`flow_id` +
  the inherited business correlation-id, the composite `uuid#seq` correlation id);
  the child's end/abort response returns as the parent task's normal callback — so
  output mappings, exception routing and fork barriers all apply unchanged. A dangling
  reference aborts at runtime with the Java message (missing-sub-flow fixture).
- **Shared parent state** (the one real Rust divergence, doc'd in `instance.rs`):
  Java aliases `model.parent`/`model.root` to the root ancestor's shared map by
  reference. Rust cannot alias, so every instance carries `Arc<Mutex<shared tree>>`
  (root's own; sub-flows resolve the root ancestor). A parent-referencing task
  (compiler-tracked `input_parent_ref`/`output_parent_ref`) materializes the tree at
  `model.parent` for the mapping pass **under the shared lock** — the Java
  `ancestor.modelSafety` analog (lock order shared → dataset everywhere) — and writes
  it back after; `model.root.*` normalizes to `model.parent.*` (one object in Java, so
  one canonical name is semantically identical). Loop conditions/sequencers on
  parent keys are out of scope (no fixture uses them; doc'd).
- **External state machine (`ext:`)**: calls collected during a mapping pass dispatch
  after the locks release (fire-and-forget sends — observationally equivalent to
  Java's inline sends, order preserved). Route form sends headers `type`
  (put/remove) + `key` with body `{data}`; the `flow://` form launches the state flow
  through the manager. `SimpleExceptionHandler` (`simple.exception.handler`) ported
  as the second engine service built-in.
- **Fixtures activated**: parent-greetings + children/daughter-greetings (the
  daughter writes `model.parent.*`, the parent reads via `model.root.*` — the alias
  round-trip), missing-sub-flow, externalize-put/get (trace-scoped external store,
  `${app.id}` config substitution, put + remove verified), fork-n-join-flows
  (sub-flow branches coordinating via parent state), and the **canonical
  fork-n-join-with-dynamic-model-test** — five concurrent `flow://echo-flow`
  sub-flows appending to the shared parent state and the external store, every
  ITEM/INDEX landing exactly once (the shared-lock serialization proven under real
  concurrency).

## 5h. Increment E-8 — the complete plugin catalog + `#[simple_plugin]` (implemented 2026-07-17)

- **All 42 built-in plugin bodies now execute**: the 19 core conversion/logical bodies
  from E-2 plus the remaining 23 — arithmetic (whole-number promotion, Java
  `promoteNumber` semantics incl. divide-by-zero guards), generators (`now` with
  iso/local/ms, `dateTime` with Java-pattern formatting), comparisons (`gt`/`lt`,
  `ternary`, case-insensitive `startsWith`/`endsWith`/`includes` with list
  membership), date parsing (`parseDate`/`parseDateTime` — a small Java-pattern →
  chrono format converter covers the yyyy/MM/dd/HH/mm/ss tokens flow files use),
  list-of-map operations (`listOfMap` normalization + column merge,
  `updateListOfMap`, `removeKey`, `uniqueSet`, `defaultValue`), and the full
  `validate` rule engine (type checks, `required`/`evaluate` modes, string/integer/
  float range checks with Java's exact error messages).
- **The user extension point**: `#[simple_plugin]` (new `event-script-macros` crate,
  the Java `@SimplePlugin` analog) registers a plugin function through the link-time
  inventory; the `SimplePluginLoader` before-application hook (sequence 3 — before
  flows compile at 5, exactly the Java loader's slot) collects every entry, so user
  plugin names validate at compile time and resolve at runtime. Name defaults to the
  camelCase of the function name (the Java class-name convention); `name = "..."`
  overrides.
- **Error propagation fixed to Java parity**: a plugin's own error message propagates
  unwrapped to the exception handler (input-validation-2 asserts the exact
  `user (ABC) < CCC` message).
- **Fixtures activated**: arithmetic, type-conversion (asserted on the rmpv tree —
  the body carries REAL bytes from `f:binary`, Java `byte[]` parity), string-util,
  parse-date/parse-date-time, input-validation-1/-2; plus a user-defined `shout`
  plugin registered via the macro and resolved through `f:shout(...)`.

## 6. Out of scope (confirmed defaults)

- **Kafka flow adapter** — the mesh is out of scope (enable-time decision).
- **Kotlin suspend variants** — Java/Kotlin-only concern; Rust is async end-to-end.
- **minigraph / knowledge-graph engine** — layer 3, its own design doc later.
- Reactor `Flux/Mono` stream payloads (E9 deferral, with platform-core §7 streams).

## 7. Open questions for the maintainer

1. **E2 fixture reuse** — copy the Java `flows/` + `parser-flows/` fixtures verbatim into
   `crates/event-script/tests/resources/` (attributing the source), or author a smaller
   Rust-native fixture set? *(Default assumption: verbatim reuse — parity for free.)*
2. **E3 JSONPath dependency** — `serde_json_path` (RFC 9535, pure Rust) acceptable as the
   Jayway analog? *(Alternative: defer `$.…` support to a later increment and fail such
   mappings at compile time until then.)*
3. **E5 scope** — comfortable with the four platform-core extensions landing as one
   platform-core increment (E-3) gated on its own tests?
4. **Plugin built-ins** — port all ~40 simple plugins in E-8, or the subset the reused
   fixtures actually exercise first? *(Default: fixture-driven subset first, rest to reach
   parity before milestone close.)*
