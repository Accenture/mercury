# AI-Companion Test Log

> A running record of the **human–AI collaboration** validation exercise: can a *fresh* AI agent,
> given only the canonical AI-agent documentation (no tutorial walkthroughs), operate the MiniGraph
> Playground and help a human build correct knowledge graphs? Each stage raises the cognitive
> demand. The point is not just pass/fail — it is to surface where `llms.txt`, the AI grammar
> (`command-reference.md` / `minigraph-commands.json`), and the human docs can be improved, and to
> harden the Rust port toward production quality along the way.

> Tracked as Open Thread `ot-companion-validation-sweep` in `memory/continuity.md`.

## Method

- **Fresh agent per test** — a new sub-agent with no prior context, briefed only with a task and a
  pointer to the canonical AI-agent docs. **As of 2026-07-18 these are ported into THIS repo** so a
  test references the Rust port's own docs (which reflect its reality — e.g. `graph.js` retired, the
  synchronous companion endpoint): `docs/llms.txt`, `docs/guides/knowledge-graph/ai-agent-guide.md`,
  `command-reference.md`, `minigraph-commands.json`, `skills-reference.md`. **Never** the interactive
  `help/*.md` or the tutorial walkthroughs. (Tutorials 1–4 used the Java upstream's copies.)
- **The companion drives the live session** over the documented endpoints. AI agents use the
  **synchronous** `POST /api/companion/{id}/sync` (outcome in-band `{ok, output, error, result}`;
  also teed to the human's WS console); `GET /api/graph/session/{id}` reads the model shape.
- **The human validates** in the Playground UI (screenshots) and via a behavioral **dry-run**.
- The orchestrator (Claude Code) may privately consult the canonical tutorial to *judge* correctness
  and assist if the companion is genuinely stuck, but never leaks it into the briefing.

## Validation ladder

| Level | Tutorials | What it tests | Briefing | Pause model | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 — mechanics + transcription** | 1–2 | drive the endpoints; look up exact syntax for a *known* graph | command list / syntax reference | step-wise | commands dispatch; graph built |
| **L2 — comprehension** | 3 | reconstruct a *specified* graph from the canonical docs alone (no walkthrough) | full node/connection plan; derive syntax | step-wise, screenshot each step | structural match to canonical + dry-run |
| **L3 — synthesis / problem-solving** | 4 | *design* a correct solution to a stated **problem + output contract**, with **no syntax hints** | problem statement only | build whole graph, pause for dry-run | **behavioral**: dry-run honors the contract on every branch |
| **L4 — composition** | 5 | *compose* mechanisms (parallel fan-out + join barrier + data sourcing + list assembly) from a problem + contract, no syntax hints | problem statement only | build whole graph, pause for dry-run | **behavioral** + demonstrable parallelism (traversal-log timing) |
| **L5+ …** | 6–13 | escalate further (error paths, extensions, sub-graphs, …) | TBD per tutorial | TBD | TBD |

## Stage records

### Tutorials 1–2 — L1 (mechanics + transcription) — PASSED
- **Method:** fresh companion agents derived the exact commands from `minigraph-commands.json` and
  built the tutorial graphs, one command at a time with human screenshot validation.
- **Result:** proved a fresh agent can (a) use the companion endpoint contract, (b) read the model
  back over the session endpoint, and (c) translate the command grammar into valid commands.
- **Doc/grammar insight:** the companion hint set should point at `docs/llms.txt` +
  `docs/guides/knowledge-graph/ai-agent-guide.md` (the AI-facing docs), not the interactive help.

### Tutorial 3 — L2 (comprehension) — PASSED
- **Task:** the Data-Dictionary method — source a person's name + address from an MDM Provider via
  two Dictionary entries + a Fetcher, keyed by `person_id`.
- **Method:** fresh companion, canonical docs only, **step-wise** with a screenshot pause per node
  and per connection.
- **Result:** built **7 nodes + 7 connections**, an **exact structural match** to the canonical
  `tutorial-3.json` (verified by an independent nodes/edges diff); dry-run with `person_id=100`
  returned `output.body = {name:"Peter", address:"100 World Blvd"}`.
- **Loose ends surfaced (engine/parity), all fixed (increments 30–32):**
  1. `@OptionalService` only gated `#[preload]` → extended to `#[websocket_service]` /
     `#[before_application]` / `#[main_application]`; the Playground was retired from programmatic
     registration to **declarative dev-gating** (increment 31, Java parity).
  2. The dev mock data providers (`mock.mdm.profile`, …) weren't ported → added, dev-gated
     (increment 30).
  3. A Dictionary node's bare `input[]=person_id` was wrongly rejected by the create/update console
     command → node-type-aware fix (Java first, then Rust).
- **Doc/grammar insight (increment 32):** the `inspect` command docs used `{…}` as a placeholder in
  the *syntax* line but **repeated the braces in the examples**, so the companion sent
  `inspect {output.body}` — which both engines resolve to the key `{output`→`body}` = empty. Fixed:
  **examples unbraced, braces only in syntax lines, + a placeholder-convention note** in
  `command-reference.md`, `ai-agent-guide.md`, `help inspect.md`, `minigraph-commands.json`.
  A first pass also changed the webapp autocomplete *template* — reverted, because a `template`
  field is a fill-in placeholder (`{variable_name}` is correct there), not an example. **Lesson: in
  the docs, `{…}` must appear only where a value is substituted, never in text meant to be typed
  verbatim.**

### Tutorial 4 — L3 (synthesis / problem-solving) — FAILED → doc fix → RE-VERIFIED PASS
- **Task (problem only, no syntax hints):** input has two parameters `a` and `b`; build a graph that
  compares them and branches two ways (`a >= b` and `a < b`). Output contract:
  `{ "message": <describes the outcome>, "less_than": <bool>, "sum": <a + b> }`. Tutorial-4's focus
  is the **decision node**.
- **Method:** fresh companion, canonical docs only, **no** node/type/mapping/`input.body.*` hints;
  built the whole graph then paused for the dry-run (step-wise pauses dropped — mechanics proven at L2).
- **Design produced (companion's own — a *valid alternative* to the canonical `Decision` node):**
  `root → compare (graph.math: sum + branch) → {ge-path | lt-path} (graph.data.mapper) → end
  (graph.data.mapper, assembles the contract)`. 5 nodes, 5 connections, all commands HTTP 200 —
  the build succeeded and read back exactly as intended.
- **Dry-run: FAILED.** `a=5,b=3` seeded fine (`input.body={a:5,b:3}`) but the run aborted at the
  `compare` node with the WS-console error:
  > `Walk to root` → `Walk to compare` → **`node compare does not have if:, then: or else:`** →
  > `Graph traversal aborted`
  Read-back confirmed total failure: `model = {}`, `output.body = Not found` (not even `COMPUTE`
  ran). The companion is **blind** to this — its POSTs returned HTTP 200 "accepted"; the parser
  error only reached the WS console, and its read-back endpoints just showed empty state.
- **Root cause — an AI-grammar gap.** The companion invented `IF: … / BEGIN / NEXT: <relation> /
  END`. The engine's real `graph.math` decision grammar is the multi-line triad
  `IF: <bool>` / `THEN: <node|next>` / `ELSE: <node|next>`. Every wrong guess was one the docs
  *caused*: `NEXT:` actually takes a **node name** (not a relation label); `BEGIN`/`END` are
  **`for_each` iteration** delimiters (not IF-block braces); and **`THEN:`/`ELSE:` appear nowhere in
  the AI-facing docs**. The AI docs (`command-reference.md`, `minigraph-commands.json`) *listed* the
  keywords (`COMPUTE`/`IF`/`MAPPING`/`EXECUTE`/`RESET` + `NEXT:`/`BEGIN`/`END`) but gave **no
  statement syntax** — the full grammar lived only in the interactive `help graph-math.md`, which the
  companion was (by design) forbidden to read. A keyword inventory without syntax was *worse than
  silence*: `BEGIN`/`END`/`NEXT:` were misleading breadcrumbs.
- **Doc fix (this session):** promoted the `graph.math` / `graph.js` **statement grammar** into the
  AI-facing docs — the `IF`/`THEN`/`ELSE` multi-line form (with a worked branch example),
  `NEXT:` = node-name, `BEGIN`/`END` = `for_each` scope, `COMPUTE` → `result` namespace,
  `MAPPING`/`EXECUTE`/`RESET`. Files: `command-reference.md` (new "statement grammar" subsection) +
  `minigraph-commands.json` (`graph.math` `statement_syntax` + notes). _(Java-canonical only — the
  Rust repo doesn't carry these guides; its `help graph-math.md` already had the full grammar.)_
- **Verification — PASSED (fix proven).** A *second* fresh companion (no knowledge of the failure or
  the doc change), same problem, now read the documented grammar and built a **runnable decision**:
  `compare` (`graph.math`) with `COMPUTE: sum -> a+b`, `COMPUTE: less_than -> a<b`, and the real
  triad `IF: a>=b / THEN: ge-path / ELSE: lt-path`; two `graph.data.mapper` branches filling the
  contract from `compare.result.*`. Dry-run on the primary session honored the contract on **all
  three** cases (types preserved — `less_than` a real boolean, `sum` a real number `8.0` in
  graph.math double precision):
  - `a=5,b=3` → `{message:"a is greater than or equal to b", less_than:false, sum:8.0}`
  - `a=3,b=5` → `{message:"a is less than b", less_than:true, sum:8.0}`
  - `a=4,b=4` → `{message:"a is greater than or equal to b", less_than:false, sum:8.0}` — the
    boundary handled **more correctly than canonical tutorial-4** (which branches on `a>b`, so
    `a==b` would wrongly take the "<" path); by computing `less_than=a<b` and branching on `a>=b`
    the companion nails the spec.
- **Additional (smaller) doc frictions from the retry, still open:** (a) boolean/float/list constant
  syntax (`boolean(...)` etc.) isn't reachable from the four AI docs (deferred to the Event Script
  page) — the companion avoided it by *computing* the boolean; consider inlining the constant-type
  table; (b) no example of one node's mapper reading another node's `.result` (bare form,
  `compare.result.sum`); (c) whether an `IF` `THEN:`/`ELSE:` jump requires a matching `connect`
  (and whether the relation label matters to routing) is unspecified; (d) a skill-less "terminate
  only" `End` is only implied. None blocked the solution; all are polish.
- **Session-management feature validated in passing.** For this run the human's primary
  (`ws-145417-6`) and a companion-side subscriber (`ws-452385-7`, a zero-dependency Node-22
  built-in-`WebSocket` `.mjs`) were linked via `session subscribe`. Content synced both ways (both
  showed 5 nodes / 5 connections) and the mirrored console stream gave the orchestrator **live
  visibility into run output** — directly mitigating finding #4: it let the orchestrator
  self-diagnose a *curl-quoting* bug of its own (zsh `$"…"` vs `$'…'`) from the console alone,
  without the human relaying it.
- **Trivial aside:** the first (failed) build showed as "untitled-1" — the root node had no `name`
  property (sets the graph title / export name); not the focus.

### Tutorial 5 — L4 (composition: parallel fan-out + join + data sourcing) — PASSED (first attempt)
- **Task (problem only, no syntax hints):** fetch the profiles of TWO people **in parallel** (both API
  calls at the same time) and return one combined response. Input: `{person1: <id>, person2: <id>}`
  (mock ids 100/200). Profile API: `GET /api/mdm/profile/{id}` on the same server (the dev mock).
  Output contract: `output.body = { "profile": [ <both profiles> ] }`, each entry carrying at least
  name and address; order irrelevant. Tutorial-5's focus is **parallelism + the `graph.join` barrier**.
- **Method:** fresh companion; **this repo's own AI docs for the first time** (`docs/llms.txt` + the
  four `docs/guides/knowledge-graph/` files — tutorials 1–4 used the Java upstream's copies); build
  whole graph → dry-run; allowed to probe the profile endpoint directly and to use anything the
  engine says **in-band**; drove the human's live UI session (`ws-976371-7`) entirely via `/sync`.
- **Result: PASSED on the first run — 18/18 commands `ok:true`, zero failed commands** (a first for
  the sweep at L3+; tut-4 needed a doc fix + retry). Design: `root` forks to `fetch-one`/`fetch-two`
  (`graph.api.fetcher`, per-fetcher `model.profile1`/`model.profile2` scratch), both converge on
  `join-profiles` (`graph.join`), and `end` (`graph.data.mapper`) assembles
  `model.profile1 -> output.body.profile[0]`, `model.profile2 -> output.body.profile[1]`; one
  shared Dictionary (`person-profile`, `response.profile -> result.profile`) + Provider
  (`mdm-profile`, `person_id -> path_parameter.id`). Dry-run (verified independently by the
  orchestrator re-running it):
  `{"profile":[{"address":"100 World Blvd","id":"100","name":"Peter"},{"address":"200 World Blvd","id":"200","name":"Mary"}]}`.
  **Parallelism proven from the traversal log:** both `Walk to fetch-*` lines precede either
  `Executed`; the two fetches (~4.5–5 ms each) complete out-of-order inside a ~6 ms total traversal;
  the join executes twice (sink, then release). Exported as `parallel-profile-fetch`.
- **Judged against canonical `tutorial-5.json` — semantically equivalent, three deliberate
  divergences, all valid and two arguably better:**
  1. **One** Dictionary returning the whole `response.profile` object vs canonical's two
     field-level entries (`person-name`, `person-address`) — fewer nodes for the same contract
     (each profile also carries `id`, a superset).
  2. **Deterministic post-join assembly** at `end` (`profile[0]`/`profile[1]`) vs canonical's
     per-fetcher append (`model.fetcher-N -> output.body.profile[]`, order undetermined) — avoids
     the concurrent-append hazard entirely and pins order (canonical's own walkthrough mentions the
     indexed variant as the order-guaranteeing option).
  3. No organizational Island node — the docs mark it optional; Provider/Dictionary stayed
     unconnected per the documented config-node exception.
  Notably the companion derived tutorial-5's **key lesson** — parallel branches must write to
  disjoint `model.*` scratch keys — on its own, with no hint.
- **KEY method finding — the five AI docs alone were *not* sufficient; in-band help bridged the
  gap.** Provider URL `{name}` placeholders and the Dictionary node's **bare** `input[]` (a parameter
  name, not a `source -> target` mapping) are documented nowhere in the five docs — the page both
  guides delegate to (`composing-the-layers.md#data-dictionary`) **doesn't exist in this repo**. The
  companion resolved both *before* authoring — `describe skill graph.api.fetcher` (documented) told it
  to run `help data-dictionary` (undocumented but discoverable), whose in-band text carries the full
  recipe — and that is why it never issued a failing command. Legitimate under the rules (in-band is
  fair game, and the `/sync` channel is exactly this feedback loop), but it means doc completeness was
  rescued by the engine's own help surface.
- **Doc frictions recorded by the companion (all candidates below, rollup #9–#13):** the dangling
  links (`composing-the-layers.md`, `build-your-first-graph.md`, `playground-and-companion.md`,
  `index.md`, `../event-script/syntax.md` — the latter owed the **full constant-type set**, tut-4
  friction (a) again); `help {topic}` absent from the grammar docs; ai-agent-guide prose still calls
  the endpoint "`/command`" post-rename; the success envelope **omits** `error`/`result` (increment-33
  null-omission) though the docs write `error: null`, and carries an undocumented `id` field; fan-out
  concurrency (multiple outgoing connections = parallel branches) implied only by `graph.join`'s notes.
- **Engine bug found by the orchestrator (not the companion): `session subscribe` issued via
  `/sync` poisons the subscriber list.** The command registers its reply route as the subscriber —
  through `/sync` that is the **ephemeral per-request capture route** (`companion.sync.<uuid>`,
  released when the POST returns), not the session's real WS `.out`. Engine state confirmed it:
  the primary reported `subscribed by ["companion.sync.3da2143d…"]` while the watcher session
  believed `subscribed to ws-976371-7`; the orchestrator's headless watcher received mirrors for ~6
  minutes, then the feed **died silently mid-test**. Java upstream mirrors the same `/sync` mechanism
  (#189) — check both ports. Workaround: issue `session subscribe` over the WS connection itself.
  Tracked as an Open Thread in `memory/continuity.md`.
- **Session-hygiene aside:** the "fresh" primary session arrived carrying a complete leftover draft
  of this very exercise (`session reset` does not clear the draft graph — it resets subscriptions);
  the orchestrator deleted all 7 nodes before briefing the companion, or the exercise would have been
  contaminated. Worth a UX note on `session reset` semantics.

## Findings → documentation & grammar improvements (rollup)

| # | From | Insight | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tut 1–2 | AI agents need the AI-facing docs, not interactive help | hint set = `llms.txt` + `ai-agent-guide.md` |
| 2 | Tut 3 | `{…}` mixed as placeholder *and* in examples misleads a literal reader/AI | unbrace examples; placeholder-convention note (increment 32) |
| 3 | Tut 4 | AI docs *list* `graph.math` statement keywords but give **no statement syntax** (no `IF`/`THEN`/`ELSE`, `NEXT:`/`BEGIN`/`END` semantics unstated) → a capable agent invents wrong-but-plausible branching that fails silently | **DONE + verified** — documented the `graph.math`/`graph.js` **statement grammar** in `command-reference.md` + `minigraph-commands.json` (IF/THEN/ELSE, NEXT:=node-name, BEGIN/END=for_each, COMPUTE→result); a fresh companion then solved Tut-4 from the problem alone |
| 4 | Tut 4 | companion is **blind to run-time errors** — POST returns 200, the parser error only reaches the WS console, read-back shows empty state | **DONE (Rust prototype, verified end-to-end)** — additive synchronous `POST /api/companion/{id}/sync` returns `{ok, output, error, result}` in-band (design: `docs/design/ai-companion-sync.md`; blueprint `bp-companion-sync`). Re-verified: a fresh companion rebuilt tutorial-4 **fully autonomously** via `/command` (built + ran + self-validated all 3 cases; explicitly *never needed the WS console or a GET fallback*); errors return in-band (`ok:false` + `error`). Java upstream PR still to follow. |
| 5 | Tut 4 | boolean/float/list **constant syntax** (`boolean(...)`, etc.) isn't reachable from the four AI docs (deferred to the Event Script page) | (candidate) inline the constant-type table into the knowledge-graph grammar |
| 6 | Tut 4 | no example of a mapper reading another node's `.result`; `IF` jump ↔ `connect` relationship unspecified; skill-less terminal `End` only implied | (candidate) add small examples/notes to the skills/command reference |
| 7 | Tut-4 live demo | **`graph.js` retired at runtime but still listed as available** in the AI docs → a fresh companion wasted three commands trying it (though it self-corrected each time via the in-band error) | **DONE** — AI docs **ported into this Rust repo** (`docs/guides/knowledge-graph/` + `docs/llms.txt`) and `graph.js` marked retired everywhere (command-reference, minigraph-commands.json, skills-reference); future tests reference the Rust repo's docs |
| 8 | Tut-4 live demo | `graph.math`'s dialect is narrower than "JS-like" implies (no bitwise ops, no function calls) and serializes integers as floats (`8.0`) with no in-grammar coercion | **DONE** — documented in the ported command-reference + skills-reference |
| 9 | Tut 5 | Provider URL `{name}` placeholder syntax and the Dictionary node's **bare** `input[]` shape are in none of the five AI docs — the page they delegate to (`composing-the-layers.md#data-dictionary`) doesn't exist in this repo; the recipe lives only in in-band `help data-dictionary` | (candidate) inline a Provider/Dictionary authoring subsection into `command-reference.md` + `minigraph-commands.json` |
| 10 | Tut 5 | `help {topic}` is the engine's own discovery surface (in-band `describe skill` even points to it) but is absent from the AI grammar docs | (candidate) document `help {topic}` as a command in `command-reference.md` + `minigraph-commands.json` |
| 11 | Tut 5 | `ai-agent-guide.md` prose still calls the synchronous endpoint "the `/command` endpoint" after the `/command` → `/sync` rename (tables/examples are correct) | (candidate) sweep the prose |
| 12 | Tut 5 | the `/sync` success envelope **omits** `error`/`result` (increment-33 serializer null-omission) though the docs write `error: null | "..."`, and carries an undocumented `id` field — a strict parser trips | (candidate) doc note: absent ⇒ null; document `id` |
| 13 | Tut 5 | fan-out concurrency (multiple outgoing connections fork **parallel** branches) is implied only by `graph.join`'s notes | (candidate) one explicit sentence in `command-reference.md` traversal/invariants |
| 14 | Tut 5 (orchestrator) | **engine bug, both ports suspected:** `session subscribe` via `/sync` registers the ephemeral `companion.sync.<uuid>` capture route as a durable subscriber → dangling subscriber, silent mirror death, asymmetric session state | **Open Thread** in `memory/continuity.md` — fix subscribe (resolve to the session's real `.out`, or reject session commands on the sync path); workaround: subscribe over the WS connection |
| 15 | Tut 5 (orchestrator) | `session reset` resets subscriptions but does **not** clear the draft graph — a "fresh" session can carry a stale (here: exercise-contaminating) draft | (candidate) UX note in `help session.md`; consider a `clear graph` affordance |
