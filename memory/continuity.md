## Project State

- **project:** mercury
- **status:** **Rust port of `mercury-composable`** (canonical Java v4.8.6), delivered bottom-up; all three in-scope layers (platform-core, event-script, active knowledge graph + Playground) ported and milestone-closed, **GRADUATED to github.com/Accenture/mercury 2026-07-20** (docs at accenture.github.io/mercury; regular PR process). Kafka service mesh + Spring out of scope. Current release **v4.12.0** (the progressive-rendering milestone, PUBLISHED 2026-08-30, tag v4.12.0; version tracks the Java line, contents by design; the python/node language packs joined the lock-step line at the same version). History/detail lives in `docs/INCREMENTS.md` (increment ledger), `draft-design-specs/`, session logs, and CHANGELOG — not this line.

## Stack & Tools

> Canonical live home for the current stack — language version, dependencies, tool
> versions. `instructions.md` keeps only a high-level descriptor and points here.

**Rust edition 2021**, toolchain 1.95.0 (latest stable at increments 1–2). Cargo **workspace**
(`Cargo.toml` root, members `crates/*`); `crates/platform-core` is the first crate.
**Deps in use:** serde 1, serde_json 1, serde_yaml 0.9 (⚠ archived upstream — works fine;
swap for a maintained fork only if it ever blocks), thiserror 1, log 0.4 (std feature),
tokio 1 (rt-multi-thread/sync/time/macros/net/signal/io-util), async-trait 0.1,
async-channel 2 (per-route MPMC queue), rmp-serde 1 + rmpv 1 (with-serde), uuid 1 (v4),
**hyper 1 (http1/server) + hyper-util 0.1 + http-body-util 0.1** (D10 — REST automation;
deliberately not a web framework: rest.yaml IS the router), **chrono 0.4 + chrono-tz 0.10 +
iana-time-zone 0.1** (event-script date/time plugins; chrono-tz = the ZoneId.of analog,
increment 53), **tokio-rustls 0.26 (ring) +
rustls-native-certs 0.8** (increment 48 — outbound HTTPS with OS-trust-store verification +
`trust_all_cert`; rcgen dev-dep for the self-signed TLS test), **moka 0.12 (sync)**
(increment 71 — the ManagedCache engine, Caffeine's Rust lineage, wrapped as an internal
detail; built with `EvictionPolicy::lru` per Eric's deterministic-eviction ruling). Stack rationale:
`platform-core-stack` + design doc D1–D10. `.gitignore` is stack-aware (Rust section:
`target/`, `**/*.rs.bk`, `*.pdb`; Cargo.lock tracked).

**Canonical source:** `mercury-composable` (Java, `com.accenture.mercury:parent-mercury`
**v4.8.6**, Java 21, Maven reactor) at `~/sandbox/mercury-composable` (added by the maintainer
2026-07-15, read-only reference). Its `docs/guides/` (architecture, event-envelope-reference,
api-overview, event-script, knowledge-graph) is the authoritative behavior spec — map, don't
mirror. Key Java deps to find Rust equivalents for: Vert.x event bus + Java 21 virtual threads
(→ async runtime), MsgPack (→ rmp-serde), Gson/JSON (→ serde_json), classgraph annotation
scanning (→ compile-time registration; no runtime scanning in Rust). platform-core alone is
~24.5K LOC / 121 files — a multi-increment port.

## Architectural Invariants

> Hard constraints that must never change. These never decay (treated as `core`).

- **Never couple functions directly** (ADR-0001) — inter-function coupling stays **route-name +
  `EventEnvelope`** only; no direct calls between user functions. This is the defining
  invariant inherited from mercury-composable (the actor-model decoupling); the whole
  three-layer design rests on it. Preserve it in the Rust port. Full ADR ledger:
  `docs/arch-decisions/ADR.md` (ADR-0001…0007 adapted from the Java repo; ADR-0008 native —
  read on demand).

- **Telemetry/log presentation parity with the Java reference implementation** — the
  trace-record topology (record count per trace, service names, parent edges,
  round_trip-vs-exec kinds, paths) and the log presentation (app-log-context gating,
  header hygiene) of this port must remain an exact structural replica of the Java
  engine's, which is THE reference. Rationale (Eric, 2026-07-23): field installations
  stay POLYGLOT for a long time — DevSecOps teams see both engines' telemetry and logs
  in one aggregation, and any presentation difference is a support burden they will
  flag. This is a standing invariant, not a one-off acceptance criterion; the Java-to-
  Java normalized signature is the acceptance instrument (see increment 64).

*(More invariants will be distilled from mercury-composable's docs/ADRs as each layer is
ported — e.g. stateless functions, HTTP-style status codes.)*

## Key Decisions

- **Port bottom-up, faithfully to the Java original** — re-implement mercury-composable in
  Rust layer by layer, foundation → UI (platform-core, then event-script, then active
  knowledge graph), preserving the Java project's behavior. The Java repo is the canonical
  spec (map, don't mirror).

## Conventions

> Established with the first code (increment 1, 2026-07-15); enforced from the first commit.

- **Suspend/resume is CORE functionality for a few field installations — this surface
  is regression-critical on BOTH engines (Eric, 2026-07-30, at the v4.11.0 publication).**
  Operating rule: behavior changes to the suspend/resume surface (the two skills, the
  walkers' suspension routing, the store contract, the reserved keys/normalization, the
  gate's suspend rules, reply shapes and presentation) get RELEASE-LEVEL care — regression
  suites on both engines, cross-engine interop verification when the wire contract is
  touched, and lock-step shipping. The permanent baseline is the interop report
  (docs/test-reports/suspend-resume-interop.md) + the twin test suites.

- **The Java repo's helper servers are the standard local test servers for Rust ports
  (Eric, 2026-07-30).** `helpers/redis-standalone` for the suspend/resume arc;
  `kafka-standalone` + the schema-registry-mock when minimalist-kafka is ported. WHY:
  the helpers embed REAL redis/kafka servers behind a plain `java -jar`, motivated by
  field reality — many developer machines are Windows, especially VDI environments with
  no virtualization system, so Docker is unavailable; a jar works everywhere. Tier: unit
  tests may use fast hermetic in-process doubles (e.g. the RESP2 test double — the
  double stands in for the SERVER, never the client); the helper is the
  integration/live-drive tier.

- **`cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean** is part of "done" for every change
  (default settings, no custom rustfmt.toml yet).
- **Apache-2.0 header** comment on every source file (ported from the Java originals'
  header style).
- Each ported module's `//!` doc names the **Java class it ports** (e.g.
  `org.platformlambda.core.util.ConfigReader`) so reviewers can diff behavior side-by-side.
- **Tests:** unit tests in-module (`#[cfg(test)]`), integration tests in `tests/` with
  fixtures under `tests/resources/` (mirrors Java's `src/test/resources`).
- **Behavior-parity notes** in doc comments wherever the Rust port deliberately mirrors a
  Java quirk (e.g. YAML-tab tolerance) or deliberately diverges — no silent divergence.
- Config-file syntax verbatim (D9): `classpath:/`, `file:/`, `${ENV:default}`, dotted routes.
- **`docs/INCREMENTS.md` is the historical ledger** (maintainer-requested, 2026-07-16):
  one overview row + one section per increment, added as part of each increment's
  definition of done (design rationale stays in `draft-design-specs/platform-core-port.md`;
  the ledger records what shipped when).
- **Example apps are standalone `examples/<name>/` workspace crates** (increment 10,
  2026-07-16): annotated functions + `platform_core::auto_start_main!();` with the app's
  `resources/` beside its `Cargo.toml` — never cargo examples inside a library crate.
  Event-script and knowledge-graph demos land as sibling `examples/<name>/` crates.
- **`tests/ui` compile-fail FIXTURES are test resources — no license headers** (Eric,
  2026-07-26: "ok with the tests/ui without license headers"): a header shifts every
  `.stderr` line and forces TRYBUILD regeneration; treated like Java's
  `src/test/resources` files. The ui RUNNERS (`tests/ui.rs`) do carry headers.
