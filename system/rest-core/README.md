# Mercury - the Post Office for microservices

## REST core library

This library imports the platform core library and adds JAX-RS and JSR-356 websocket support.

It includes JSON and XML serializers and custom HTTP error handler.

This library will be published and available from a public repository at a later time.

## Publish locally

You may also compile the library from source and publish it locally in your development laptop.
To do this, clone this project and perform "mvn clean install".

## sbt

This project may also be built using SBT because we use SBT to publish to artifactory. The build.sbt is provided as an example.
