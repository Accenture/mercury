rest:

  # Optionally, you can add "authentication" service to validate incoming request from the external application.

  # service should be a target service name or a list of service names
  # If more than one service name is provided, the first one is the primary target
  # and the rest are secondary target(s). The system will copy the HTTP request event to the secondary targets.
  #
  # This feature is used for seamless legacy system migration where we can send
  # the same request to the old and the new services at the same time for A/B comparison.

    # Optional authentication service which should return a true or false result
    # The authentication service can also add session info in headers using EventEnvelope as a response
    # and annotate trace with key-values that you want to persist into distributed trace logging.
    #
    # You can also route the authentication request to different functions based on HTTP request header
    # i.e. you can provide a single authentication function or a list of functions selected by header routing.
    #
    # If you want to route based on header/value, use the "key: value : service" format.
