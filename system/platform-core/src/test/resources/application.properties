# environment variables (comma separated list of environment variable names)

# When present, an environment variable will be used as a surrogate Java system property.
# For example, JAVA_HOME will be used as a shadow system property for parameter "java.home" in this property file.

# Each environment variable name should be in UPPER_CASE and underscore format.
# To change the mapping, use a colon to customize.
