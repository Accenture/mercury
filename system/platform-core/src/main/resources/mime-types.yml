#
# Extension to MIME type mapping for static content
#
# By default, the system supports the following:
# js: application/json
# html: text/html
# htm: text/html
# txt: text/plain
# css: text/css
#
# Any other extensions are served as application/octet-stream
#
# This is a minimalist list of MIME types.
#
# You can add a mime.types section in your application.yml to override or add
# MIME types that are required in your application.
