# Platform core library

This is the engine for writing composable application.

## Spring Boot

This foundation library does not have Spring framework or Spring Boot dependencies so that it can be used
with Spring Boot or other frameworks.

The "spring-boot-parent" dependency in the pom.xml is a convenient way to fetch latest open sources libraries
that have been vetted by the Spring community.
