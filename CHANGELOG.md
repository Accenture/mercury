## Version 4.9.0, 7/20/2026

**Graduation release — and the adoption of the canonical version line.** The version jumps
from 0.1.0 to **4.9.0** to track `mercury-composable` (Java), with which this engine is
behavior-synced: the companion REST contract is byte-identical, the graph/flow DSLs are
shared, and every engine fix since the port began landed in both implementations
(mercury-composable PRs #187–#204, released there as 4.9.0 the same day). One version, two
languages.

Everything since 0.1.0, in brief (increments 30–49 — the full record in
[`docs/INCREMENTS.md`](docs/INCREMENTS.md)):

### Added

1. **The synchronous AI-companion endpoint** `POST /api/companion/{id}/sync` (ADR-0008) —
   command outcomes in-band (`{ok, output, error, result}`, whole-traversal capture, WS tee
   for real-time human+AI collaboration), with a truthful contract: whole-output-aware `ok`
   classification, no silent dedup for RPC callers, `Syntax:` usage hints classify as
   failures.
2. **Discovery + contract commands**: `list graphs` / `list flows` / `describe graph
   {graph-id}` — self-service delegation (list → contract → delegate) with the root
   `purpose` enforced at compile as living documentation.
3. **Outbound HTTPS for the async HTTP client** (rustls + OS trust store, per-request
   `trust_all_cert`) — field-validated end-to-end against a live CA chain. Redirects are
   deliberately not followed (backend design; documented decision record in
   `docs/design/platform-core-port.md` §5j).
4. **Numeric promotion + `f:round`** for the simple-plugin arithmetic family.
5. **The battle-tested AI-agent documentation**: hardened by 25 fresh-agent exercises
   across both engines (the last thirteen passing with zero documentation lookups) and
   kept in lock-step with the Java repo (back-port #203 there).
6. **The human documentation site** — 20 pages, published at
   [accenture.github.io/mercury](https://accenture.github.io/mercury/) (automated via
   `mkdocs gh-deploy` on pushes to main).
7. **Rust CI quality gates** — fmt + clippy (zero warnings) + the full workspace test
   suite on every PR.

### Fixed

1. **Join barrier: only valid completions count** — success-only completion marks cleared
   by `RESET`, and chained joins judged by recorded outcome (latent data-loss bugs found by
   probe, fixed in both engines).
2. **Companion `session` limited to the read-only status query** (topology subcommands are
   a WebSocket-session privilege).
3. **HTTP-boundary content-type dispatch** mirrors the Java `handlePayload` rules exactly.
4. Spring-named configuration keys retired: `app.profiles.active` / `application.name`.

**Verified:** 206 workspace tests green, `clippy` zero warnings, `fmt` clean — enforced in
CI from this release on.

## Version 0.1.0, 7/18/2026

The first end-to-end port of `mercury-composable` (Java, canonical v4.8.6) to Rust: the three
foundational layers, ported bottom-up (foundation → UI) across 29 verified increments and
validated against the canonical Java fixture suite. **This is the first port ready for manual
end-to-end testing** — 181 workspace tests green, `clippy` clean, `fmt` clean.

Out of scope by design: the Kafka service mesh (`minimalist-kafka`, `twin-kafka`, connectors)
and Spring (`rest-spring-3/-4`). `graph.js` is deliberately **retired** — an interpreter running
arbitrary user code is an attack surface the port does not carry; `graph.math` (typed, bounded)
and `graph.task` (reviewed, compiled functions) cover its use cases.

### Added

**platform-core (layer 1) — the actor-model event bus and operable runtime**

1. **Configuration management, event bus, and reactive back-pressure** — the `-D`/YAML config
   reader, the route-addressed event bus (functions coupled only by route name + `EventEnvelope`),
   and the FIFO ElasticQueue with manager–worker back-pressure (disk spill under overload).
2. **Application lifecycle and annotation macros** — `#[preload]` / `#[before_application]` /
   `#[main_application]` / `#[zero_tracing]` with link-time `inventory` registration (the Java
   classpath-scan analog), plus the one-line `auto_start_main!()` entry point.
3. **Observability** — OpenTelemetry-style distributed tracing, business correlation-id, and
   app-log-context (three-format logger).
4. **REST automation and operability** — `rest.yaml` as the router on a hyper HTTP edge,
   actuators (`/info`, `/env`, `/health`, `/livenessprobe`), and the static-content protocol
   (SHA-256 etag / HTTP-304, no-cache pages, the `static-content.filter` request interceptor).
5. **RPC inbox, HTTP client, and WebSocket server** — the lightweight RPC inbox (`AsyncInbox`
   parity), the async HTTP client (`async.http.request`), and the WebSocket server on the HTTP
   upgrade path with the declarative `#[websocket_service]` macro.

**event-script (layer 2) — the composable-flow engine**

6. **Flow model, compiler, and data-mapping engine** — the full `CompileFlows` port (all Java
   fixtures reused verbatim) and the runtime MultiLevelMap mapping engine over `rmpv::Value`
   (direct composite-key access primary; JSON-Path `$.…` for complex queries).
7. **The complete flow runtime** — sequential / response / decision / sink, parallel and
   fork/join (pipe-map barrier), pipelines with for/while loops and break/continue, `flow://`
   sub-flows with shared parent state, and the external state machine — plus TTL abort, metrics,
   and the flow-summary span.
8. **Plugins, HTTP, and resilience** — all 42 built-in plugins with the `#[simple_plugin]` macro,
   the HTTP flow adapter, the resilience handler, and the event-script mock.

**active knowledge graph (layer 3) — the MiniGraph Playground**

9. **MiniGraph and the graph toolchain** — the MiniGraph property graph (a platform-core
   built-in), the math expression engine, and the graph compiler + registry (13 tutorial
   fixtures compiled verbatim; the engine crate ships its own bundled resources).
10. **The graph runtime and core skills** — the executor state machine (composite `{flow}@{node}`
    correlation, decision routing, loop detection) and the core skills `graph.data.mapper`,
    `graph.math`, `graph.task`, `graph.join`, `graph.island`, `graph.api.fetcher`,
    `graph.extension`, plus the declarative `#[fetch_feature]` macro (OAuth 2.0 bearer
    injection). `graph.js` is retired.
11. **The Playground** — the command grammar (`GraphCommandService` port), the graph traveler,
    the WebSocket UI (`/ws/graph`, `/ws/json`), the AI-companion REST hop
    (`POST /api/companion/{id}`), and dev-gating (`app.env=dev`); the React webapp
    (`@xyflow/react`) served as static content by REST automation.

**Examples**

12. `examples/hello-world` (layer 1), `examples/hello-flow` (layer 2 — a YAML flow over HTTP),
    and `examples/minigraph-playground` (layer 3 — the runnable Playground app at
    `http://127.0.0.1:8100/`).
