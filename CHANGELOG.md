## Version 0.1.0, 7/18/2026

The first end-to-end port of `mercury-composable` (Java, canonical v4.8.6) to Rust: the three
foundational layers, ported bottom-up (foundation → UI) across 29 verified increments and
validated against the canonical Java fixture suite. **This is the first port ready for manual
end-to-end testing** — 181 workspace tests green, `clippy` clean, `fmt` clean.

Out of scope by design: the Kafka service mesh (`minimalist-kafka`, `twin-kafka`, connectors)
and Spring (`rest-spring-3/-4`). `graph.js` is deliberately **retired** — an interpreter running
arbitrary user code is an attack surface the port does not carry; `graph.math` (typed, bounded)
and `graph.task` (reviewed, compiled functions) cover its use cases.

### Added

**platform-core (layer 1) — the actor-model event bus and operable runtime**

1. **Configuration management, event bus, and reactive back-pressure** — the `-D`/YAML config
   reader, the route-addressed event bus (functions coupled only by route name + `EventEnvelope`),
   and the FIFO ElasticQueue with manager–worker back-pressure (disk spill under overload).
2. **Application lifecycle and annotation macros** — `#[preload]` / `#[before_application]` /
   `#[main_application]` / `#[zero_tracing]` with link-time `inventory` registration (the Java
   classpath-scan analog), plus the one-line `auto_start_main!()` entry point.
3. **Observability** — OpenTelemetry-style distributed tracing, business correlation-id, and
   app-log-context (three-format logger).
4. **REST automation and operability** — `rest.yaml` as the router on a hyper HTTP edge,
   actuators (`/info`, `/env`, `/health`, `/livenessprobe`), and the static-content protocol
   (SHA-256 etag / HTTP-304, no-cache pages, the `static-content.filter` request interceptor).
5. **RPC inbox, HTTP client, and WebSocket server** — the lightweight RPC inbox (`AsyncInbox`
   parity), the async HTTP client (`async.http.request`), and the WebSocket server on the HTTP
   upgrade path with the declarative `#[websocket_service]` macro.

**event-script (layer 2) — the composable-flow engine**

6. **Flow model, compiler, and data-mapping engine** — the full `CompileFlows` port (all Java
   fixtures reused verbatim) and the runtime MultiLevelMap mapping engine over `rmpv::Value`
   (direct composite-key access primary; JSON-Path `$.…` for complex queries).
7. **The complete flow runtime** — sequential / response / decision / sink, parallel and
   fork/join (pipe-map barrier), pipelines with for/while loops and break/continue, `flow://`
   sub-flows with shared parent state, and the external state machine — plus TTL abort, metrics,
   and the flow-summary span.
8. **Plugins, HTTP, and resilience** — all 42 built-in plugins with the `#[simple_plugin]` macro,
   the HTTP flow adapter, the resilience handler, and the event-script mock.

**active knowledge graph (layer 3) — the MiniGraph Playground**

9. **MiniGraph and the graph toolchain** — the MiniGraph property graph (a platform-core
   built-in), the math expression engine, and the graph compiler + registry (13 tutorial
   fixtures compiled verbatim; the engine crate ships its own bundled resources).
10. **The graph runtime and core skills** — the executor state machine (composite `{flow}@{node}`
    correlation, decision routing, loop detection) and the core skills `graph.data.mapper`,
    `graph.math`, `graph.task`, `graph.join`, `graph.island`, `graph.api.fetcher`,
    `graph.extension`, plus the declarative `#[fetch_feature]` macro (OAuth 2.0 bearer
    injection). `graph.js` is retired.
11. **The Playground** — the command grammar (`GraphCommandService` port), the graph traveler,
    the WebSocket UI (`/ws/graph`, `/ws/json`), the AI-companion REST hop
    (`POST /api/companion/{id}`), and dev-gating (`app.env=dev`); the React webapp
    (`@xyflow/react`) served as static content by REST automation.

**Examples**

12. `examples/hello-world` (layer 1), `examples/hello-flow` (layer 2 — a YAML flow over HTTP),
    and `examples/minigraph-playground` (layer 3 — the runnable Playground app at
    `http://127.0.0.1:8100/`).
