List nodes, connections, graphs or flows
----------------------------------------
Show all nodes or all connections of the current graph model - or discover
the deployable graph models and Event Script flows of this server.

Syntax
------
```
list nodes
list connections
list graphs
list flows
```

Notes
-----
- 'list graphs' (discovery, read-only) enumerates the deployable graph
  models - the valid extension={graph-id} delegation targets - each with
  its root node's "purpose" property, so the listing reads as living
  documentation of the enterprise knowledge on this server.
- 'list flows' (discovery, read-only) enumerates the Event Script flows -
  the valid extension=flow://{flow-id} delegation targets.
- 'list nodes' prints each node with its type: the root node first, the end
  node last, and the other nodes in alphabetical order. A missing root or
  end node is flagged with "(does not exist)".
- 'list connections' prints one line per connection with its relation
  label(s).
- Use 'describe node {name}' for the full detail of a single node (see
  'help describe').
