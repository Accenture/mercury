Tutorial 14
-----------
In this session, you will build a purchase workflow with THREE human checkpoints - a customer
orders, the store manager approves (or rejects with a reason, which ends the workflow), the
delivery department releases the shipment, and the parcel ships to the customer. One graph
model, four short runs, one correlation ID.

When to use suspension
----------------------
Any multi-step process that must WAIT mid-way fits this pattern - waiting for a person (an
approval, missing information requested by email) or waiting for another system (a batch job
that takes hours and calls back when done). The workflow pauses instead of ending: its state
is kept in an external store under the business correlation ID - the ticket or order number -
and any application instance resumes it when the reply arrives.

Pre-requisite
-------------
Workflow suspension persists state to an external store through two composable functions. This
tutorial uses the Redis store from the "minigraph-state-redis" extension - the playground
application already includes it, so "v1.redis.persist.model" and "v1.redis.retrieve.model" are
registered automatically. Start a Redis before you run the graph (the "redis-standalone" helper
application works out of the box).

What is workflow suspension?
----------------------------
An approval may take minutes or days. Instead of parking a live graph instance, the graph
persists its workflow state - the "model" namespace - under the business correlation ID and the
run completes normally. A later request with the same correlation ID restores that state and
continues past the checkpoint without re-executing it. Three vocabulary pieces make this work:

1. the "suspend" node - a reserved node name (like root and end) with the "graph.suspend" skill.
   ONE suspend node serves every suspension point in the graph, reached two ways: a CHECKPOINT
   NODE - a working node with a DRAWN EDGE to it - pauses when its skill completes (the edge is
   the declaration, no property needed), and a DECISION NODE pauses by returning "suspend" from
   its IF-THEN-ELSE (the decision is RE-EXECUTED against the new input on every resume)
2. a checkpoint node - any working node (graph.data.mapper here; graph.task, graph.api.fetcher
   and graph.extension work the same way) that draws its checkpoint edge to "suspend" plus a
   continuation edge to the next step; a resumed run continues along the continuation and never
   re-executes the node. A checkpoint never decides - reaching it IS the decision to pause
3. the resume node - the "graph.resume" skill placed right after root; it restores a persisted
   record and continues at the LAST suspension point: past a checkpoint along its continuation,
   or by re-executing the decision that paused the workflow. A fresh transaction flows through -
   either way it sets "model.run" to "resume" or "fresh" so the graph's own logic can react

The graph navigation is:

```
root -> resume -> order -> check-approval -> approval -> delivery -> ship -> end
              (checkpoint)     |      \-> manager-reject -> end     (order, approval and
                               |                                     delivery draw edges
                               +--returns 'suspend' when no valid    to suspend)
                                  decision - and re-decides on
                                  every resume
```

Each checkpoint node captures its actor's input into the model and suspends; each following
run resumes one checkpoint further. The model is the workflow's durable memory - anything a
later step needs must be mapped into "model.*" before the checkpoint. The manager's decision
lands at a graph.math decision node on the order checkpoint's continuation with THREE
outcomes: an approved decision routes to the next suspension point, an explicit rejection
routes to a terminal node that reports the manager's reason (the workflow ends), and anything
else - a missing or unrecognized decision - returns "suspend" to pause again, so an invalid
request can never end a long-running workflow by accident: the decision re-executes on the
next resume and re-evaluates whatever arrives.

Create the graph model
----------------------
Create the root node:

```
create node root
with properties
purpose=Purchase workflow with three human checkpoints
name=tutorial-14
```

Create the resume node. A resumed run jumps past its last checkpoint; a fresh transaction
(no record - never suspended, or expired) continues along the forward path into the
"check-fresh" validation gate with "model.run" set to "fresh":

```
create node resume
with type Resume
with properties
purpose=Restore workflow state if this transaction was suspended earlier
skill=graph.resume
task=v1.redis.retrieve.model
```

Create the input validation gate. The variable substitution inside the text() constant is
null-safe: when the request has no "item" field it is not an order submission, so a later-stage
request without a suspended record is rejected:

```
create node check-fresh
with type Decision
with properties
purpose=A fresh transaction must be an order submission
skill=graph.math
statement[]=MAPPING: text(={input.body.item}) -> model.order_probe
statement[]=IF: {model.order_probe} == '=null'
THEN: reject
ELSE: order
```

Create the three checkpoint nodes. Each captures its actor's input into the model and stages a
stage-specific reply for the caller (overriding the default suspended response). No property is
needed: the drawn edge to the suspend node (you will connect it below) IS the suspension
declaration. A checkpoint node is a complete working node - it executes its skill in full and
may carry any non-routing skill (graph.data.mapper here; graph.task, graph.api.fetcher and
graph.extension work the same way) - only its exit changes. The "Suspensible" type is purely
visual - it picks the node color in the Playground:

```
create node order
with type Suspensible
with properties
purpose=Capture the customer order, then suspend for the store manager
skill=graph.data.mapper
mapping[]=input.body -> model.order
mapping[]=text(order-submitted; waiting for store manager approval) -> output.body.stage
mapping[]=model.run -> output.body.run
mapping[]=model.cid -> output.body.cid
```

```
create node approval
with type Suspensible
with properties
purpose=Capture the store manager approval, then suspend for the delivery department
skill=graph.data.mapper
mapping[]=input.body -> model.approval
mapping[]=text(approved; waiting for the delivery department to release the shipment) -> output.body.stage
mapping[]=model.run -> output.body.run
mapping[]=model.cid -> output.body.cid
```

```
create node delivery
with type Suspensible
with properties
purpose=Capture the shipment release, then suspend for shipment confirmation
skill=graph.data.mapper
mapping[]=input.body -> model.delivery
mapping[]=text(released; waiting for shipment confirmation) -> output.body.stage
mapping[]=model.run -> output.body.run
mapping[]=model.cid -> output.body.cid
```

Create the manager decision. It sits on the order checkpoint's continuation, so every resumed
run lands here with the manager's input. Three outcomes: "approved" continues to the approval
checkpoint, "rejected" ends the workflow with the manager's reason, and anything else RETURNS
"suspend" to pause - the decision pattern. A pausing decision draws NO edge to the suspend node
(its drawn edges are outcome alternatives, and the gate rejects a decision-to-suspend edge); it
is re-executed against the new request input on every resume, so the workflow simply keeps
waiting until an explicit "approved" or "rejected" arrives - a wait loop with no extra nodes.
The probe reuses the same null-safe idiom as "check-fresh". The awaiting reply is staged
unconditionally before the IFs; the approval and rejection paths overwrite it downstream:

```
create node check-approval
with type Decision
with properties
purpose=Approved continues, rejected ends the workflow, anything else keeps waiting
skill=graph.math
statement[]=MAPPING: text(={input.body.decision}) -> model.approval_probe
statement[]=MAPPING: text(awaiting-decision; supply decision approved or rejected for the store manager) -> output.body.stage
statement[]=MAPPING: model.run -> output.body.run
statement[]=MAPPING: model.cid -> output.body.cid
statement[]=IF: {model.approval_probe} == '=approved'
THEN: approval
ELSE: next
statement[]=IF: {model.approval_probe} == '=rejected'
THEN: manager-reject
ELSE: suspend
```

```
create node manager-reject
with type mapper
with properties
purpose=The manager rejected the purchase: report the reason and end the workflow
skill=graph.data.mapper
mapping[]=text(rejected) -> output.body.stage
mapping[]=input.body.reason -> output.body.reason
mapping[]=model.order -> output.body.order
mapping[]=model.run -> output.body.run
mapping[]=model.cid -> output.body.cid
```

Create the completion, rejection, suspend and end nodes:

```
create node ship
with type mapper
with properties
purpose=Ship to the customer with the full order history
skill=graph.data.mapper
mapping[]=text(shipped) -> output.body.stage
mapping[]=model.run -> output.body.run
mapping[]=model.order -> output.body.order
mapping[]=model.approval -> output.body.approval
mapping[]=model.delivery -> output.body.delivery
mapping[]=input.body -> output.body.shipment
mapping[]=model.cid -> output.body.cid
```

```
create node reject
with type mapper
with properties
purpose=Reject a request that has no suspended transaction and is not an order
skill=graph.data.mapper
mapping[]=int(404) -> output.status
mapping[]=text(rejected) -> output.body.type
mapping[]=text(Transaction not found. Submit the order first) -> output.body.message
mapping[]=model.run -> output.body.run
```

```
create node suspend
with type Suspend
with properties
purpose=Persist workflow state to Redis and wait for the next actor
skill=graph.suspend
task=v1.redis.persist.model
ttl=1h
```

```
create node end
```

Connect the nodes. Every checkpoint node draws BOTH edges - the checkpoint edge to "suspend"
(the suspension declaration) and the continuation edge to the next step (where a resumed run
continues). The check-approval decision draws only its outcome edges - its waiting path is
the jump inside the IF-THEN-ELSE:

```
connect root to resume with then
connect resume to check-fresh with fresh
connect check-fresh to order with submission
connect check-fresh to reject with no-transaction
connect order to suspend with checkpoint
connect order to check-approval with next
connect check-approval to approval with approved
connect check-approval to manager-reject with rejected
connect manager-reject to end with then
connect approval to suspend with checkpoint
connect approval to delivery with next
connect delivery to suspend with checkpoint
connect delivery to ship with next
connect ship to end with then
connect reject to end with then
connect suspend to end with then
```

For your convenience, this graph model is preloaded as "tutorial-14".

Dry-run the workflow interactively
----------------------------------
You can exercise all three checkpoints without leaving the playground. Two things to
remember: instantiate before every run so each round starts with a fresh state machine
(on this engine 'run' may repeat on one instance and model values persist across runs -
see 'help run' - which would pollute a short-run simulation); and the SAME model.cid
must be supplied each time - it is the resume key. Redis must be running.

Import the deployed model as a draft:

```
import graph from tutorial-14
```

Run 1 - the customer orders a laptop:

```
instantiate graph
text(order-1001) -> model.cid
text(laptop) -> input.body.item
int(2000) -> input.body.amount
```

```
run
```

The traversal walks root -> resume -> check-fresh -> order -> suspend -> end and the run
completes normally - the workflow state now lives in Redis, not in memory. Inspect the
staged reply:

```
inspect output.body
```

It shows stage=order-submitted..., run=fresh (a new transaction) and cid=order-1001.

Run 2 - the store manager approves. Instantiate again with the same correlation ID and
the manager's input:

```
instantiate graph
text(order-1001) -> model.cid
text(approved) -> input.body.decision
text(store-88) -> input.body.manager
```

```
run
```

Watch the console: the resume node restores the persisted state and the traversal
continues at the check-approval decision - the order checkpoint is NOT re-executed. The
approved decision routes to the approval checkpoint. Now "inspect output.body" shows
stage=approved... and run=resume, and the "seen" command lists the order node as visited
even though this run never executed it - that is the restored traversal bookkeeping.

(The manager could reject instead: the same run with
"text(rejected) -> input.body.decision" and "text(budget exceeded) -> input.body.reason"
routes to manager-reject - the reply carries stage=rejected with the reason and the
original order, and the workflow ends. And if the run carries no valid decision at all -
including a replay against a leftover suspended record from an earlier exercise - the
workflow does NOT end: it replies stage=awaiting-decision and re-suspends, waiting for a
proper "approved" or "rejected". You will try both over REST below. Tip: records are
consumed on resume and re-created on each suspension, so if you repeat these exercises,
use a fresh correlation ID for each clean start.)

Run 3 - the delivery department releases the shipment:

```
instantiate graph
text(order-1001) -> model.cid
boolean(true) -> input.body.release
text(express) -> input.body.courier
```

```
run
```

Run 4 - shipment confirmation completes the workflow:

```
instantiate graph
text(order-1001) -> model.cid
text(TRK-12345) -> input.body.tracking
```

```
run
```

Inspect the final reply - the model accumulated state across all four short runs:

```
inspect output.body
```

It shows stage=shipped, run=resume, and the full history: order (laptop/2000), approval
(approved/store-88), delivery (release/express) and shipment (TRK-12345).

To see the input validation, start over with a correlation ID that never ordered:

```
instantiate graph
text(order-9999) -> model.cid
text(approved) -> input.body.decision
```

```
run
```

"inspect output" shows status=404 with type=rejected and run=fresh - the order must come
first, and the run flag tells the caller why. Each record is consumed on resume, so
repeating any middle run behaves the same way: no record means a fresh transaction.

Test the workflow over REST
---------------------------
Run 1 - the customer orders a laptop:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8085/api/graph/tutorial-14 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Correlation-Id: order-1001" \
  -d '{"item": "laptop", "amount": 2000}'
```

The reply is {"stage": "order-submitted; waiting for store manager approval", "run": "fresh",
"cid": "order-1001"} and the run is over - nothing stays in memory. Every stage reply carries
the "run" flag ("fresh" on run 1, "resume" on runs 2 to 4) so the caller always knows whether
it is looking at a new transaction or a resumed continuation. Run 2 - the store manager approves:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8085/api/graph/tutorial-14 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Correlation-Id: order-1001" \
  -d '{"decision": "approved", "manager": "store-88"}'
```

Run 3 - the delivery department releases the shipment:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8085/api/graph/tutorial-14 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Correlation-Id: order-1001" \
  -d '{"release": true, "courier": "express"}'
```

Run 4 - shipment confirmation completes the workflow:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8085/api/graph/tutorial-14 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Correlation-Id: order-1001" \
  -d '{"tracking": "TRK-12345"}'
```

The final reply carries the whole history - the order from run 1, the approval from run 2, the
release from run 3 and the shipment from run 4 - proof that the workflow state crossed every
suspension. Now try a decision with a correlation ID that never ordered:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8085/api/graph/tutorial-14 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Correlation-Id: order-9999" \
  -d '{"decision": "approved"}'
```

The workflow rejects it with HTTP-404 - the order must come first - and the reply's
"run": "fresh" tells the UI why: the record expired or never existed. Each record is consumed on
resume, so a duplicated request at any stage behaves like a fresh transaction instead of
executing that stage twice.

Finally, try the manager's other option - reject with a reason. Submit a new order, then
reject it:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8085/api/graph/tutorial-14 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Correlation-Id: order-2002" \
  -d '{"item": "monitor", "amount": 300}'
```

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8085/api/graph/tutorial-14 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Correlation-Id: order-2002" \
  -d '{"decision": "rejected", "reason": "budget exceeded"}'
```

The reply is {"stage": "rejected", "reason": "budget exceeded", "order": {...}, "run": "resume",
"cid": "order-2002"} and the workflow is over - the record was consumed on resume and nothing
re-suspended, so any further request under order-2002 is a fresh 404 rejection.

An invalid or missing decision behaves differently - the workflow stays alive. Submit another
order under order-3003, then send a request with no decision:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8085/api/graph/tutorial-14 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Correlation-Id: order-3003" \
  -d '{"note": "no decision here"}'
```

The reply is {"stage": "awaiting-decision; supply decision approved or rejected for the store
manager", "run": "resume", "cid": "order-3003"} and the workflow re-suspended - repeat with
{"decision": "approved"} and it continues to the delivery stage as usual. Only an explicit
"approved" or "rejected" moves the workflow forward.

Summary
-------
In this session, we expressed a purchase workflow with three human checkpoints as four short
graph runs keyed by one business correlation ID: one reserved "suspend" node served every
checkpoint, each checkpoint node declared its suspension with a drawn edge, captured its
actor's input into the model and staged its own stage response, a graph.math decision at the
manager's resumption point routed an approval to the next checkpoint, a rejection (with the
manager's reason) to the end, and anything else returned "suspend" to pause again (a pausing
decision re-executes and re-decides on every resume, so no extra wait nodes are needed),
input validation enforced the order-before-decision sequence, and the engine-managed
"model.run" flag told every reply whether the run was fresh or resumed.

Why suspend and resume?
-----------------------
Real business processes wait on people - repeatedly. Suspension turns each wait into a durable
record instead of a parked runtime: any application instance sharing the state store can resume
the workflow, restarts lose nothing, and each run stays short and observable. The state store is
pluggable - Redis is the packaged implementation, and any composable function honoring the
documented store contract can replace it.
