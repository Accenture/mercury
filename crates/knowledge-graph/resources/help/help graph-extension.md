Skill: Graph Extension
----------------------
Delegates to another graph model (a sub-graph) or to an Event Script flow,
so larger capabilities compose from smaller ones. The node passes named
inputs to the target, and the target's response body becomes this node's
result. This is the seam between the knowledge-graph layer and the Event
Script layer beneath it.

Route name
----------
"graph.extension"

Properties
----------
```
skill=graph.extension
extension={graph-id}           (a deployed sub-graph ...)
extension=flow://{flow-id}     (... or an Event Script flow)
input[]={source} -> {key}
output[]={source} -> {target}
```

- extension (required) - the target. A graph id resolves among DEPLOYED
  graph models only (compiled at startup from the app's resources/graph
  folder - the same ids callable at POST /api/graph/{graph-id}). A session
  draft is NOT addressable: export and deploy it first. A missing id fails
  the node fast at run time. A flow target takes the flow:// prefix, e.g.
  extension=flow://hello-world.
- input[] (required) - each entry's TARGET is a bare key that becomes the
  target's input.body.{key}. There is NO whole-body "*" target on this
  skill - map named keys (the "*" merge idiom is graph.task-only; see
  'help graph-task').
- output[] (optional) - maps the result onward; the result always lands at
  {node}.result regardless.

Optional:

```
for_each[]={array-source} -> model.{var}   (iterate over a runtime list)
concurrency={1-30}                         (parallel fan-out, default 3)
exception={error-handler-node}             (jump on failure instead of abort)
```

Result set
----------
This node's result namespace IS the target's output.body:

- bare "result" in an output[] mapping is the whole response body
- result.{key} is a field of it

The same contract applies to both target kinds: the named input keys feed
the sub-graph's or flow's input.body, and result.* is its output.body.

Example
-------
```
create node performance-evaluator
with type Extension
with properties
skill=graph.extension
extension=evaluate-sales-performance
input[]=input.body.department_id -> id
output[]=result.sales_performance -> output.body.sales_performance
```

Here input.body.department_id feeds the sub-graph's input.body.id, and the
sub-graph's output.body.sales_performance comes back as
result.sales_performance.

Notes
-----
- Failure routing: on failure, {node}.status and {node}.error are set and
  the output[] mappings are skipped. With exception={handler-node},
  traversal jumps to the handler instead of aborting; without it, the run
  aborts. The bounded-retry pattern is shown under 'help graph-api-fetcher'.
- for_each[]={array-source} -> model.{var} invokes the target once per
  element of a runtime list, with bounded parallel fan-out (concurrency
  1-30, default 3). The shared iteration rules are under
  'help graph-api-fetcher'.
- Use graph.extension for multi-step orchestration; use graph.task for a
  single composable-function call.
