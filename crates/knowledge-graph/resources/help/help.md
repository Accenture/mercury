MiniGraph
---------
A mini-graph is a property graph that is designed to run entirely in memory.
It is recommended that you limit the number of nodes to less than 750.

Graph Model is used to describe a business use case using graph methodology.
Optionally, you may configure a nodes to have a special skill to react to incoming events.

Instance Model is an instance of a graph model that is used to process a specific business use case
or transaction. It is created when an incoming event arrives. It will map data attributes from input
of a request to properties of one or more nodes.

Execution of an instance model will start from the root node of a graph until it reaches the end node.
Result of the end node will be returned to the calling party.

For a model to be meaningful, you must configure at least one node to have a skill to process the data
attributes of some nodes (aka "data entities"). A skill is a property with the label "skill" and the
value is a composable function route name.

For more information about each feature, try the following help topics.

For graph model
---------------
- help create (node)
- help delete (node, connection or cache)
- help update (node)
- help edit (node)
- help connect (node-A to node-B)
- help list (node or connection)
- help export
- help import (graph or node)
- help describe (graph, node, connection or skill)
- help data-dictionary
- help session (display, subscribe or reset session)

For instance model
------------------
- help instantiate (create an instance from a graph model)
- help upload (mock data)
- help execute (skill of a specific node. Graph traversal is paused to enable functional test in isolation.)
- help inspect (state-machine for properties of nodes, input, output and model namespaces)
- help run (execute a graph instance from a root node to the end node, if any, using graph traversal.)
- help seen (display the nodes that have been seen or executed)

Built-in skills
---------------
1. graph.data.mapper - map data from one node to another
2. graph.math - perform simple math function and boolean operation using native Java
3. graph.js - handle simple math function and boolean operation using a JavaScript engine
4. graph.api.fetcher - make API call to other systems
5. graph.extension - issue API call to another graph model
6. graph.island - this indicates that the node leads to isolated nodes and graph traversal would pause
7. graph.join - a node with this skill will wait for completion of all nodes that connect to it
8. graph.task - invoke a composable function through its route name
