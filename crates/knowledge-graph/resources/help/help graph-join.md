Skill: Graph Join
-----------------
A synchronization barrier for parallel branches. A node with this skill
returns "next" only when ALL upstream nodes connected to it have completed;
until then it returns ".sink" (the arriving path pauses). Use it to bring
forked branches back together before continuing.

Route name
----------
"graph.join"

Properties
----------
```
skill=graph.join
```

No other properties are required or accepted.

Example
-------
```
create node join
with type Join
with properties
skill=graph.join
```

Fork, then join:

```
connect root to fetch-name with fetch
connect root to fetch-address with fetch
connect fetch-name to join with done
connect fetch-address to join with done
connect join to combine with proceed
```

Notes
-----
- The fork side needs no special node: multiple outgoing connections from one
  node run their branches in parallel.
- A join is only meaningful with two or more upstream connections. Without a
  join, traversal simply proceeds as each branch completes.
- Data mapping is thread-safe (state-machine operations are serialized), but
  parallel branches must not write the SAME scalar key - the last writer
  wins, nondeterministically. Use disjoint keys (e.g. per-branch model.*
  variables), or append to a shared list with the race-free "[]" target form
  (element order then follows completion order). When the final order must
  be deterministic, assemble with numeric indices after the join, e.g.
  fetch-name.result.profile -> output.body.profile[0]. See
  'help graph-data-mapper'.
